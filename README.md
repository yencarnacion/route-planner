create a single page web app that can help me to monitor and create a route, entering all the addresses. 
keep all html, javascript, css in the single html file which you will call index.html
use a map so that i can add a stop by just right clicking on the map and selecting add stop or entering a street address 
in a text field. use leaflet 1.9.4, tile.openstreetmap.org, and default to san juan, puerto rico.  you should be able to add/delete stops, 
move stops up/down, edit stops, and save with a name you choose the route once satisfied.
